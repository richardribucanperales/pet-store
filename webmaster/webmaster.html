<p class=p>My name is Richard Ribucan-Perales and I am the owner of Richard's Petstore! Richard's petstore is based off of a project that I completed over a 3 day period, meticulously finding pictures as well as sounds to put into the webpage! I can't thank you enough Mrs. Takara and Mr. Sakata for teaching me HTML! You guys make a great team in teaching this stuff! I did this as a little extra so you guys could see that I have actually learned something from you and the internet and just didn't goof off in class.</p>
